    <a class="title">About Rowing</a><br>
    <br>Rowing is both physically and mentally challenging. It can require a substantial time commitment with top crews training 6 days per week and second crews at least 4 times per week thoughout the year.<br>
    <br>HOWEVER it is without doubt the most rewarding of all sports, fosters close bonds between squad members and gives you a pretty amazing body and guaranteed first tan of the year.<br>
    <br>We concentate on sweep-oar rowing, which is where each crew member has a single oar, as opposed to sculling where each rower has two oars.<br>
    <br>Training takes place on land - on the rowing machines (known as ergs) and in the gym doing weights and circuits - as much as on the river.<br>
